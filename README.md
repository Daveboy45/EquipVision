# EquipVision -Predictive Maintenance Solution
# 

## Overview

EquipVision aims to forecast equipment or machine failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime. This project leverages machine learning models, including Random Forests, LSTM networks, and ARIMA, to analyze historical performance data and predict future failures. 


### Frontend

- **Purpose:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the predictive maintenance system. Users can visualize equipment data, view predictions, and schedule maintenance through dynamic dashboards.
- **Technologies:**
  - **HTML/CSS:** For creating and styling the user interface.
  - **Bootstrap:** For responsive and modern UI components.
  - **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and connecting to the backend APIs.
- **Structure:**
  - `/public` - Static files such as HTML and images.
  - `/src` - Source code for React components, styles, and utilities.
  - `/static` - Static assets used by the frontend.

### Backend

- **Purpose:** Manages data processing, machine learning model training, and API endpoints for communication with the frontend.
- **Technologies:**
  - **Django:** Serves as the backend framework for building APIs, handling data, and managing user interactions.
  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis, preparing data for machine learning models.
  - **NumPy:** Provides numerical computations needed for model operations and data processing.
  - **scikit-learn:** Implements traditional machine learning models like Random Forests for failure prediction.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras:** Develops and trains deep learning models to enhance prediction accuracy.
  - **XGBoost:** Utilizes gradient boosting techniques for robust predictive modeling.
  - **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Used for visualizing data trends and model results.
  - **ARIMA:** Applies time-series forecasting to predict equipment failures and maintenance needs.
- **Structure:**
  - `/api` - Contains Django views and API endpoints.
  - `/models` - Includes machine learning models and training scripts.
  - `/utils` - Utility functions for data preprocessing and model management.
  - `/data` - Raw and processed data files.
  - `manage.py` - Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.

### Docker

- **Purpose:** Containerizes the application for consistent deployment and management.
- **Structure:**
  - `Dockerfile` - Defines the image build process for the application.
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Manages multi-container deployment, including frontend and backend services.

### Documentation

- **Purpose:** Provides architectural and design details for understanding and maintaining the system.
- **Structure:**
  - `architecture.md` - Describes the system's architecture, components, and interactions.

### Tests

- **Purpose:** Ensures the reliability and functionality of the application through automated testing.
- **Structure:**
  - `/unit` - Unit tests for individual components and functions.
  - `/integration` - Integration tests for end-to-end workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Historical performance data, sensor readings, and maintenance logs are collected and stored.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Data is preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure time-series stationarity.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Machine learning models (Random Forests, LSTM) and ARIMA are trained on historical data to predict equipment failures and remaining useful life.

4. **Prediction:**
   - The trained models generate forecasts of future equipment failures, enabling users to schedule maintenance proactively.
